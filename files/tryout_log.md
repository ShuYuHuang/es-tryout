            As with any stir-fry, you want to do all of your prep ahead of time because the cooking goes very quickly.
            This Americanized version replaces those hard-to-find-ingredients with staples from your neighborhood supermarket.
            3. Meanwhile, chop the bell pepper, celery, scallions, and garlic.
            4. In another medium bowl, prepare the sauce by whisking together all of the sauce ingredients: balsamic vinegar, soy sauce, hoisin sauce, sesame oil, sugar, cornstarch, red pepper flakes, ground ginger, and water.
            Since the chicken needs to marinate for 15 minutes, get that started first.

        - Mixing of results from both source
        - Not enought top_k amout for 2 sources
- Conclusion of tryout
    > Query from multiple sources needs more top_k amout, and it causes information coupling
    - Solution 1: Multi-layer DB
        - 1st layer: indices for files
        - 2nd layer: indices for word chunks in files
        ```
        Provide more accurate file source
        Cannot resolve the multi-source query demand
        ```
    - Solution 2: Multi-layer QA:
        - 1st QA: Organize separate queries needed
        - n'th QA: Query for each sub-problem
        ```
        Provide accurate file source while resolve the multi-source demand
        Cost more tokens and takes more time

            Based on the queried results, the materials needed for the recipe are not provided. The queried results only mention the cooking process and the substitution of ingredients, but they do not mention the specific materials required for the recipe. Therefore, we cannot determine the materials needed based on the given information.
